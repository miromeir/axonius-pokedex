# Axonius Pokedex - React UI

This is a take-home task for Axonius.
<br/>

### Important - First, make sure your [Backend](https://github.com/miromeir/axonius-pokedex-server) is running.
Then:
<br/>
```
git clone git@github.com:miromeir/axonius-pokedex.git
cd axonius-pokedex
yarn install
yarn start
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 ~*due to dark magic localhost and 127.0.0.1 render different sizes for me. I suggest localhost but you can try both*~
*due to chrome ~bug~ feature I worked at 75% zoom. 100% works fine, could use some css polishing*
